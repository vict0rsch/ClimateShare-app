// About content
const aboutTitle = "About ClimatePix";

const aboutText = `This project has been initiated from an effort of the Qu√©bec Institute for 
Artificial Intelligence (Mila, Quebec) to obtain a dataset of flood pictures 
in order to build Machine Learning models that will be useful for the society. \n 
Public awareness and concern about climate change often do not match the magnitude 
of its threat to humans and our environment. One reason for this disagreement 
is that it is difficult for young people to mentally simulate the effects of 
climate change, which is an inherently complex process. \nOur project aims to 
address this issue by developing an interactive educational tool to present 
accurate and personalized outcomes of climate change as well as their underlying 
processes. \nBy downloading this app, you will be able to send us your pictures 
of floods, fires, earthquakes etc. and your help will be greatly appreciated!`;
