## Getting Started

First you need to install expo, a set of tools, libraries and services you can use to build native iOS and Android apps easily.

You can install Expo CLI by running:
```
npm install -g expo-cli
```

You have additional documentation on what Expo is here : https://docs.expo.io/versions/v32.0.0/

# Now you can build the app :

Download with: 

```
git clone 
```

Install Libs:

``` 
sudo yarn
```

Now you can start expo for testing your app:

``` 
expo start
```

You'll need to download expo mobile-app on the store. Then with the previous command, a browser page will open. Go to Local and you'll have a QR code. Scan it and the app will open on your phone.

If you want to build the app for Android and get an APK file do :

```
expo build:android
```


They will ask if you want to use a key, say no if it is just a test but you would have to use the same exact key as I use if you want to upload on the store.
